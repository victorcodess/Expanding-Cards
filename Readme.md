# Expanding Cards

This is a project form a course by Brad Traversy. It's bascically a webpage with cards of pictures that expand.

## How it works

So bascically, I created image cards with HTML and CSS with the initial card having a second class of "active". But most of it's fuctionality comes from telling Javascript to takeout the "active" class for the initial card and add that to what ever card you click on.Hence making it bigger, beacause this now transfers the styling to the clicked card.
