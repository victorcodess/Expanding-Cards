# Expanding Cards

Expanding cards are used to reveal images in sites. When the user clicks on a cards, it expands and reveals the image with its contents(including texts and links).

This is a project form a course by Brad Traversy.

## Lessons Learned

#### CSS
I learn about CSS transitions and how to make a transition seamless by manipulating the speed and duration of the transition. I also learnt about flex-box and flex directions. 

#### JavaScript
I learnt a about JavaScript DOM manipulations using query selectors.
I also learnt about event listeners, which added a class to a card when the user clicks the card.
